# Cursor Workflow Rule: UI/UX Wireframing Phase

**Goal:**
Create low-fidelity layouts to define the app's structure and functionality.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Generate Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Create wireframes for key screens (e.g., homepage, user dashboard) based on user flows and sitemap.
- Include placeholders for content, navigation, and interactive elements (e.g., buttons, forms).
- Focus on layout, hierarchy, and functionality, avoiding detailed visuals.

### 2. Annotate Wireframes
- Add notes to clarify interactions (e.g., "Tapping this button opens a modal").
- Specify content types (e.g., "Image placeholder for product thumbnail").

### 3. Gather and Incorporate Feedback
- Suggest questions for stakeholder feedback, such as: "Does the layout support key user tasks?" or "Are any critical features missing?"
- Summarize feedback and propose revisions to address concerns.

### 4. Check Accessibility
- Ensure wireframes include accessibility considerations, such as logical tab order, sufficient spacing for touch targets, and clear content hierarchy.
- Flag potential issues (e.g., small touch targets) and suggest fixes.

---

## Rationales
- Low-fidelity wireframes allow rapid iteration, catching structural issues early without investing in visuals.
- Annotations clarify intent, reducing miscommunication with stakeholders and developers.
- Early feedback ensures alignment with project goals, preventing costly revisions later.
- Accessibility checks ensure the design is inclusive, meeting standards like WCAG 2.1.

## Deliverables

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

#### Screen: Homepage
- **Layout:**
  - Header: [Logo, navigation menu]
  - Body: [Search bar, featured content grid]
  - Footer: [Quick links, social icons]
- **Interactions:**
  - Search bar: Triggers search results screen
  - Featured content: Tapping opens detail view
- **Accessibility:**
  - Tab order: Header → Search → Content → Footer
  - Touch targets: Minimum 44x44px

#### Screen: User Dashboard
- [Similar structure as above]

### Feedback Summary
- **Stakeholder Input:** [e.g., "Add a filter button to homepage"]
- **Proposed Revisions:** [e.g., Include filter button in search bar]

### Accessibility Notes
- [e.g., Ensured sufficient spacing for touch targets; recommend high-contrast text for next phase]

## Guidance for AI Assistant

- **Proactivity:** Anticipate designer needs by suggesting additional tasks (e.g., "Would you like me to generate more user flow variations?") without overwhelming them.
- **Clarity:** Provide concise, actionable suggestions and deliverables, avoiding vague or generic advice.
- **Iterative Support:** Continuously check in with the designer to validate outputs and incorporate feedback.
- **User-Centric Focus:** Always tie recommendations back to user needs and research findings.
- **Consistency:** Ensure deliverables align across phases (e.g., wireframes reflect sitemap, mockups reflect prototype).
- **Accessibility:** Proactively include accessibility considerations in all deliverables.

---

### Conversational Process
- Only ask one focused question at a time to guide the designer through each step.
- Wait for confirmation or feedback before proceeding to the next step.
- Iterate based on feedback, ensuring each deliverable is validated before moving forward.
