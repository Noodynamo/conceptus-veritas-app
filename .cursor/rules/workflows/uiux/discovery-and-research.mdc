# Cursor Workflow Rule: UI/UX Discovery and Research Phase

**Goal:**
Understand the users, business objectives, and project scope to lay a foundation for user-centered design.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Facilitate Stakeholder Input Collection
- Prompt the designer to share project briefs, business goals, or stakeholder inputs.
- Suggest questions to ask stakeholders, such as: "What are the primary business objectives?"
- Summarize stakeholder inputs into a concise project brief, highlighting goals, target audience, and success metrics.

### 2. Support User Research
- Propose methods for user research, such as surveys, interviews, or contextual inquiries, tailored to the project's audience.
- Generate sample survey questions or interview scripts (e.g., "What challenges do you face with similar apps?"
- Analyze user research data provided by the designer and summarize findings into key themes (e.g., user needs, pain points, preferences).
- Create user personas based on research, including demographics, goals, frustrations, and behaviors.

### 3. Conduct Competitive Analysis
- Suggest analyzing 3-5 competitor applications to identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps.
- Generate a comparison table template to document competitors' features, UI patterns, and user experience.
- Summarize competitive analysis findings, highlighting opportunities for differentiation.

### 4. Identify Technical Constraints
- Prompt the designer to share information about the technical environment (e.g., platform, device types, or integrations).
- Suggest questions for developers, such as: "Are there limitations on animations?"
- Document technical constraints to inform design decisions.

### 5. Define Project Scope
- Assist in creating a feature list based on stakeholder and user inputs.
- Prioritize features using a framework like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have).
- Draft a project scope statement summarizing key deliverables (e.g., wireframes, prototypes) and timelines.

---

## Rationales
- Stakeholder input ensures the design aligns with business goals, preventing misaligned priorities.
- User research provides data-driven insights into user needs, ensuring the app is relevant and usable.
- Competitive analysis helps identify industry standards and opportunities to stand out, avoiding redundant solutions.
- Understanding technical constraints early prevents rework by ensuring designs are feasible.
- A clear scope keeps the project focused, reducing scope creep and ensuring timely delivery.

## Deliverables

### Discovery and Research Summary

#### Project Brief
- **Business Goals**: [Summarize stakeholder goals, e.g., increase user engagement by 20%]
- **Target Audience**: [Summarize audience, e.g., young professionals aged 25-35]
- **KPIs**: [List metrics, e.g., user retention rate, task completion time]

#### User Personas
- **Persona 1**: [Name, age, goals, frustrations, behaviors]
- **Persona 2**: [Name, age, goals, frustrations, behaviors]

#### User Journey Map
- **Key Tasks**: [List tasks, e.g., sign up, complete profile]
- **Pain Points**: [List issues, e.g., complex navigation]
- **Opportunities**: [List improvements, e.g., simplified onboarding]

#### Competitive Analysis
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Opportunities |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| App A      | [e.g., Intuitive navigation] | [e.g., Poor accessibility] | [e.g., Add voice input] |
| App B      | [e.g., Clean UI] | [e.g., Limited features] | [e.g., Offer customization] |

#### Technical Constraints
- [List constraints, e.g., Must support iOS and Android, no complex animations]

#### Project Scope
- **Key Features**: [List prioritized features]
- **Deliverables**: [e.g., Wireframes, prototypes, design system]
- **Timeline**: [e.g., Research completed by Week 2]

## Guidance for AI Assistant

- **Proactivity:** Anticipate designer needs by suggesting additional tasks (e.g., "Would you like me to generate more user flow variations?") without overwhelming them.
- **Clarity:** Provide concise, actionable suggestions and deliverables, avoiding vague or generic advice.
- **Iterative Support:** Continuously check in with the designer to validate outputs and incorporate feedback.
- **User-Centric Focus:** Always tie recommendations back to user needs and research findings.
- **Consistency:** Ensure deliverables align across phases (e.g., wireframes reflect sitemap, mockups reflect prototype).
- **Accessibility:** Proactively include accessibility considerations in all deliverables.

---

### Conversational Process
- Only ask one focused question at a time to guide the designer through each step.
- Wait for confirmation or feedback before proceeding to the next step.
- Iterate based on feedback, ensuring each deliverable is validated before moving forward.
