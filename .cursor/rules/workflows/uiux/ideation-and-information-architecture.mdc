# Cursor Workflow Rule: UI/UX Ideation and Information Architecture Phase

**Goal:**
Structure the application's content and functionality to support intuitive user journeys.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Facilitate Brainstorming
- Suggest brainstorming prompts based on research, such as: "How can we simplify onboarding for new users?" or "What features address [specific pain point]?"
- Summarize brainstorming outcomes into a list of potential features or design ideas.

### 2. Map User Flows
- Create user flow diagrams for key tasks (e.g., signing up, completing a purchase) based on personas and research.
- Identify entry points, decision points, and exit points for each flow.
- Highlight potential friction areas (e.g., too many steps) and suggest simplifications.

### 3. Develop Information Architecture
- Draft a sitemap outlining the app's screens and their hierarchy (e.g., Home > Profile > Settings).
- Suggest navigation patterns (e.g., tab bar, hamburger menu) based on the app's complexity and platform.
- Validate the sitemap with the designer to ensure it supports user tasks and business goals.

### 4. Conduct Task Analysis
- Break down complex user tasks into step-by-step actions (e.g., "Search for product" → "Enter query" → "View results").
- Suggest optimizations to reduce steps or cognitive load.

---

## Rationales
- Brainstorming generates creative solutions informed by research, ensuring user and business needs are addressed.
- User flows clarify how users navigate the app, preventing confusion and ensuring intuitive interactions.
- A well-structured information architecture organizes content logically, improving usability and scalability.
- Task analysis ensures designs are efficient, minimizing user effort and frustration.

## Deliverables

### Information Architecture and User Flows

#### Sitemap
- Home
  - Profile
    - Edit Profile
    - Settings
  - Search
    - Results
    - Filters
  - [Other key sections]

#### User Flows
##### Task: [e.g., Sign Up]
- **Entry Point**: Landing page
- **Steps**:
  1. Click "Sign Up" button
  2. Enter email and password
  3. Confirm email via verification link
  4. Complete profile setup
- **Exit Point**: Dashboard
- **Friction Points**: [e.g., Too many form fields]
- **Suggestions**: [e.g., Allow social login to simplify]

##### Task: [e.g., Complete Purchase]
- [Similar structure as above]

#### Navigation Pattern
- **Proposed**: [e.g., Bottom tab bar for mobile]
- **Rationale**: [e.g., Easy thumb access, supports 4-5 main sections]

## Guidance for AI Assistant

- **Proactivity:** Anticipate designer needs by suggesting additional tasks (e.g., "Would you like me to generate more user flow variations?") without overwhelming them.
- **Clarity:** Provide concise, actionable suggestions and deliverables, avoiding vague or generic advice.
- **Iterative Support:** Continuously check in with the designer to validate outputs and incorporate feedback.
- **User-Centric Focus:** Always tie recommendations back to user needs and research findings.
- **Consistency:** Ensure deliverables align across phases (e.g., wireframes reflect sitemap, mockups reflect prototype).
- **Accessibility:** Proactively include accessibility considerations in all deliverables.

---

### Conversational Process
- Only ask one focused question at a time to guide the designer through each step.
- Wait for confirmation or feedback before proceeding to the next step.
- Iterate based on feedback, ensuring each deliverable is validated before moving forward.
