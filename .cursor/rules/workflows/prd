# Cursor Workflow Rule: Product Requirement Document (PRD) Planning

**Purpose:**
Guide the AI assistant through a structured, collaborative planning and brainstorming process to produce a comprehensive Product Requirement Document (PRD) for a software project or feature.

---

## Goals
- Achieve a clear, actionable, and robust product requirements specification aligned with user and business needs.
- Ensure all objectives, constraints, and success metrics are thoroughly understood and documented.
- Facilitate collaborative, iterative decision-making and solution selection.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Discovery Initiation
- Begin by gathering the user's high-level objectives, constraints, target audience, and success metrics.
- If needed, use available tools for context gathering:
  - Codebase inspection (for existing systems)
  - Web search for domain or competitor research
- Document all discovered context and requirements in Markdown or AsciiDoc files as needed.

### 2. Iterative Clarification
- Ask focused, single questions to resolve ambiguities or fill gaps in requirements.
- Confirm understanding of objectives, constraints, and user needs with the user, summarizing back periodically.
- Continue clarification until all requirements are unambiguous and agreed upon.

### 3. Solution Brainstorming & Evaluation
- Generate multiple potential solution approaches.
- Compare and contrast these options based on:
  - Feasibility
  - Development effort
  - User experience
  - Scalability
  - Cost
  - Alignment with objectives and constraints
- Guide the user in selecting or refining the optimal solution path.

### 4. Proposal Drafting
- Present a structured proposal of the chosen solution, including:
  - Rationale for the approach
  - Key decisions and trade-offs
  - Any open questions or unresolved issues
- Require explicit user approval of the proposal before proceeding to PRD finalization.
- Summarize the proposal in Markdown or AsciiDoc for review.

### 5. PRD Finalization
- Upon user approval, create a file named `PRD.adoc` in the workspace root using AsciiDoc format.
- The PRD must include the following sections:
  1. Title & Version
  2. Overview
  3. Goals & Success Metrics
  4. Assumptions & Constraints
  5. Target Audience & Stakeholders
  6. User Stories / Use-cases
  7. Requirements (Functional and Non-functional)
  8. Solution Architecture / High-level Design
  9. Milestones & Timeline
  10. Acceptance Criteria
  11. Open Questions & Future Work

---

## Interaction Guidelines
- Confirm all assumptions and requirements with the user before documenting them.
- Break down complex requirements into manageable components for discussion and documentation.
- Proactively identify and document potential risks, open questions, and dependencies.
- Summarize and validate all major decisions and requirements with the user at each phase.
- Use clear, concise language to facilitate understanding.

---

## File Modification Constraints
- **Strictly limit edits to Markdown (`.md`) and AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) files during this planning phase.**
- The only non-negotiable code edit is the creation or update of the final PRD file (`PRD.adoc`).
- Do NOT modify any code or configuration files during this process.

---

## Exit Criteria
- The planning process is complete when:
  - The user has explicitly approved the solution proposal.
  - The comprehensive PRD file (`PRD.adoc`) has been generated or updated in the workspace.

## Tool Usage Cheat Sheet (Optional)
| Information Need                | Recommended Tool           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Inspect codebase                | codebase_search, read_file|
| Research domain/competitors      | web_search                |
| Summarize requirements          | edit_file (Markdown/AsciiDoc) |

**Note:**
- The focus is on collaborative, iterative planning and documentation, not implementation.
