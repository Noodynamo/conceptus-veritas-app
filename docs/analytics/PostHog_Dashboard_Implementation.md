## Overview

This implementation plan defines how the KPIs and metrics outlined in our measurement framework will be visualized in PostHog dashboards. The plan ensures that all stakeholders have access to the data they need in a format that supports decision-making.

## Data Requirements

To implement these dashboards, we need to ensure the following data is being tracked in PostHog:

### User Properties

These properties should be associated with each user:

```typescript
{
  // Standard properties
  email: string,
  name: string,
  createdAt: string,
  app_version: string,
  device_type: string,

  // Custom properties
  wisdom_xp_total: number,
  wisdom_xp_level: string,
  subscription_tier: 'free' | 'premium' | 'pro',
  current_streak_days: number,
  longest_streak_days: number,
  active_quests_count: number,
  completed_quests_count: number,
  concept_mastery: Record<string, number>,
  preferred_philosophical_tone: string,
  ask_interactions_count: number,
  journal_entries_count: number,
  forum_contributions_count: number,
  last_seen_feature: 'Ask' | 'Quest' | 'Explore' | 'Journal' | 'Forum' | 'Profile'
}
```

### Core Events

The following events are required for basic dashboard functionality:

1. **Lifecycle Events**

   - `ph_user_signed_up`
   - `ph_onboarding_completed`
   - `ph_subscription_viewed`
   - `ph_subscription_upgraded`

## Dashboard Configurations

Each dashboard will be created with the following configurations:

### Dashboard Settings

- **Auto-refresh**: Enable with appropriate interval (5min for Technical, 1hr for others)
- **Default time range**: Last 30 days (with user-configurable option)
- **Access control**: Based on user roles (see Access Control section)
- **Color scheme**: Use application brand colors for consistency
- **Filter persistence**: Enable to allow users to save their filter combinations

### Insight Configurations

Each insight (chart) will include:

- Clear title explaining what is being measured
- Description with the metric definition
- Target value or benchmark when applicable
- Consistent color coding (e.g., red for negative trends)
- Appropriate visualization type for the data
- Data sampling rate if applicable
- Segmentation options when relevant

## Access Control

Dashboard access will be configured as follows:

| Dashboard  | Executive Team | Product Team | Marketing Team | Engineering Team | Data Analysts |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Executive  | Edit           | View         | View           | No access        | Edit          |
| Growth     | View           | Edit         | Edit           | View             | Edit          |
| Engagement | View           | Edit         | View           | View             | Edit          |
| Retention  | View           | Edit         | View           | View             | Edit          |
| Revenue    | Edit           | Edit         | View           | No access        | Edit          |
| Product    | View           | Edit         | View           | Edit             | Edit          |
| Technical  | View           | View         | No access      | Edit             | Edit          |

## Review Process

Each dashboard will undergo the following review process before being finalized:

1. **Initial Creation**: Data team creates dashboard based on requirements
2. **Data Validation**: Verify all metrics are accurate and properly calculated
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Key stakeholders review and provide feedback
4. **Refinement**: Incorporate feedback and make adjustments
5. **Documentation**: Document dashboard contents and usage
6. **Release**: Make dashboard available to appropriate users
7. **Training**: Provide training sessions for dashboard users

## Maintenance Plan

To ensure dashboards remain relevant and accurate:

1. **Regular Review**: Quarterly review of all dashboards
2. **Data Quality Checks**: Weekly data quality validation
3. **User Feedback Collection**: Monthly feedback from dashboard users
4. **Version Control**: Track dashboard changes in version control
5. **Performance Optimization**: Quarterly performance review of queries
6. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation current with changes
7. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure dashboards continue to meet business needs

## Next Steps

1. Validate event tracking implementation against data requirements
2. Set up PostHog project and team permissions
3. Create dashboard templates based on specifications
4. Implement Phase 1 dashboards
5. Schedule stakeholder review session
6. Document initial dashboards
