## Data Collection Principles

All analytics data collection must adhere to these principles:

### 1. Data Minimization

- Collect only the data necessary for defined business purposes
- Avoid collecting personally identifiable information (PII) unless essential
- Use data anonymization and pseudonymization techniques whenever possible
- Regularly review collected data to ensure continued relevance

### 2. Purpose Limitation

- Clearly define and document the purpose for each data point collected
- Use data only for the purposes disclosed to users
- Require internal review for any new use of existing data

### 3. Storage Limitation

- Implement maximum data retention periods:
  - User-level data: 25 months maximum
  - Aggregated analytics data: 5 years maximum
  - Raw event data: 13 months maximum
- Automatically delete or anonymize data after retention period
- Document justification for retention periods

### 4. Special Category Data

- Do not collect sensitive data related to:
  - Philosophical beliefs (despite app focus, we don't categorize user beliefs)
  - Religious beliefs
  - Political opinions
  - Health data
  - Biometric data
- If collection becomes necessary, implement enhanced protection measures

## User Consent Management

### 1. Consent Collection

- Implement clear consent mechanism during onboarding
- Use layered consent approach:
  - Essential analytics (app functionality)
  - Product improvement analytics (optional)
  - Marketing analytics (optional)
- Provide clear descriptions of each category
- Avoid pre-checked consent boxes (GDPR requirement)

### 2. Consent Storage

- Store consent records with:
  - Timestamp
  - Consent version
  - Specific categories accepted
  - Method of consent collection
- Maintain audit trail of consent changes

### 3. Consent Management

- Allow users to modify consent settings at any time
- Implement in-app privacy settings screen
- Process consent withdrawals within 72 hours
- Notify users of significant changes to data practices

### 4. Consent UI Requirements

- Clear language (avoid technical/legal jargon)
- Visual separation of different consent categories
- Easy access to privacy policy
- Single-click opt-out mechanism
- Age-appropriate design for younger users

## Data Processing and Storage

### 1. Data Security
