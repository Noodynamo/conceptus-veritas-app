## 11. Potential Conflicts and Considerations

### Cosmic Visualization Consistency
- **Issue**: The Forum feature uses the same cosmic visualization metaphor as the Explore feature
- **Resolution**: Ensure consistent color coding, animation styles, and interaction patterns
- **Action Required**: Coordinate with Explore feature implementation team

### Concept Connection System
- **Issue**: The Forum feature introduces community-built concept connections that may affect the Concepts System
- **Resolution**: Ensure the Concepts System can accommodate community-defined relationships
- **Action Required**: Coordinate with Concepts System implementation team

### Journal Integration
- **Issue**: The Forum feature includes multiple integration points with the Journal feature
- **Resolution**: Ensure consistent data structures and context preservation
- **Action Required**: Coordinate with Journal feature implementation team

### Performance Considerations
- **Issue**: Cosmic visualizations may be resource-intensive on mobile devices
- **Resolution**: Implement progressive rendering and simplified view options
- **Action Required**: Update Section 13 (Performance Optimization) if needed

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Issue**: Highly visual cosmic interface may present accessibility challenges
- **Resolution**: Ensure text-based alternatives and keyboard navigation
- **Action Required**: Update Section 6.5 (Accessibility) with Forum-specific considerations
