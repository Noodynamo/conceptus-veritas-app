# Areas Needing Clarification for Enhanced Journal Feature

## 1. Constellation Mapping Implementation

### Questions:
- **Visualization Technology**: What specific visualization technology should be used for the constellation map? (WebGL, Canvas, SVG, or a specialized library)
- **Node Representation**: How should different types of content be visually distinguished in the constellation? (Journal entries, saved AI responses, quest completions, etc.)
- **Connection Types**: What specific connection types should be available between nodes? (e.g., "inspired by," "contradicts," "builds upon")
- **Performance Thresholds**: What is the expected maximum number of nodes that should be efficiently displayed in the constellation view?
- **Mobile vs. Desktop Experience**: Should the constellation experience be identical across devices or simplified for mobile?

## 2. Quick Entry Feature Scope

### Questions:
- **Quick Entry Persistence**: Should the Quick Entry button be globally accessible throughout the app or only in specific sections?
- **Media Limitations**: Are there size or duration limits for media captured in Quick Entry mode? (e.g., maximum video length)
- **Default Privacy Settings**: What should be the default privacy setting for Quick Entries? (Private, same as last entry, or context-dependent)
- **Geolocation Precision**: What level of geolocation precision is appropriate? (City-level, neighborhood, exact coordinates)
- **Follow-up Notifications**: How soon after a Quick Entry should follow-up prompts appear to encourage expansion?

## 3. Concept Detection and Tagging

### Questions:
- **Concept Detection Threshold**: What confidence threshold should trigger automatic concept suggestion?
- **Maximum Concepts Per Entry**: Is there a limit to how many concepts should be associated with a single entry?
- **Concept Hierarchy**: How should parent-child relationships between concepts be represented in the tagging interface?
- **User-Created Concepts**: Should users be able to create custom concepts not in the master concept list?
- **Concept Weighting**: Should concepts have different weights/importance within an entry?

## 4. Cross-Feature Clipboard Integration

### Questions:
- **Clipboard Persistence**: How long should items remain in the clipboard before expiring?
- **Clipboard Capacity**: Is there a limit to how many items can be stored in the clipboard?
- **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Should the clipboard state sync across user devices in real-time?
- **Clipboard Organization**: Beyond organizing by source, should there be additional organization options (date, concept, etc.)?
- **Clipboard Privacy**: Can clipboard items be shared directly, or must they be incorporated into an entry first?

## 5. Template System

### Questions:
- **Template Creation Permissions**: Should template creation be limited to premium tiers or available to all users?
- **Template Sharing**: Should users be able to share custom templates with others?
- **Template Components**: What specific components should templates be able to include? (Pre-filled text, media placeholders, concept tags, etc.)
- **Template Recommendations**: What factors should influence template recommendations? (Time of day, user history, entry content)
- **Default Templates**: What specific default templates should be included at launch?

## 6. Multimedia Handling

### Questions:
- **Storage Allocation**: What storage limits should apply to different subscription tiers?
- **Media Processing**: Should media be processed on-device or server-side? (Compression, transcoding, etc.)
- **Media Organization**: Beyond the entry context, how should media be organized for retrieval? (Tags, albums, etc.)
- **Media Editing**: What in-app editing capabilities should be available for different media types?
- **Media Sharing**: What options should be available for sharing media from journal entries?

## 7. Premium Feature Boundaries

### Questions:
- **Tier Structure**: What specific features should be limited to each subscription tier?
- **Constellation Limitations**: What aspects of constellation mapping should be available in free vs. paid tiers?
- **Template Limitations**: How many custom templates should be allowed per tier?
- **Media Limitations**: What media storage limits should apply to each tier?
- **Sharing Capabilities**: What sharing options should be restricted to premium tiers?

## 8. Accessibility Considerations

### Questions:
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: How should the constellation map be made accessible to screen reader users?
- **Color Blind Support**: What specific color schemes should be used to ensure visibility for color-blind users?
- **Voice Input Accuracy**: What measures should be taken to improve voice input accuracy for diverse accents and speech patterns?
- **Keyboard Navigation**: What keyboard shortcuts should be implemented for efficient navigation?
- **Text Size Adjustments**: How should the interface adapt to very large text sizes for visually impaired users?

## 9. Performance Optimization

### Questions:
- **Offline Capabilities**: What specific journal functions should work offline?
- **Sync Behavior**: How should conflicts be resolved when offline entries are synced?
- **Large Media Handling**: How should the app handle very large media files on devices with limited storage?
- **Entry Size Limits**: Should there be a maximum size limit for individual entries?
- **Background Processing**: What processes should be deferred to background processing to maintain UI responsiveness?

## 10. Implementation Phasing

### Questions:
- **Feature Prioritization**: Which specific features should be prioritized for initial release vs. later phases?
- **Beta Testing Approach**: What methodology should be used for beta testing the enhanced journal features?
- **Migration Strategy**: How should existing journal entries be migrated to support new features?
- **Rollout Strategy**: Should new features be released all at once or gradually with A/B testing?
- **Success Metrics**: What specific metrics should be used to measure the success of the enhanced journal features?
