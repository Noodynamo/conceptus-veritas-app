# DevOps Dashboard Testing Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Prometheus and Grafana monitoring stack in the staging environment for the Conceptus Veritas App. The testing procedures ensure that the monitoring infrastructure is correctly deployed, secure, and functioning as expected before promoting to production.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Kubernetes staging cluster
- `kubectl` configured to connect to the staging cluster
- `curl` and `jq` installed on the local machine
- Network access to the staging environment

## Test Categories

The testing framework covers the following categories:

1. **Infrastructure Validation**: Verifying that all components are deployed and running
2. **API Testing**: Ensuring that APIs are accessible and responsive
3. **Metrics Validation**: Confirming that metrics are being collected correctly
4. **Security Testing**: Validating network policies and access controls
5. **Performance Testing**: Assessing system behavior under load
6. **Integration Testing**: Verifying that Prometheus and Grafana work together correctly
7. **Rollback Testing**: Testing the rollback procedure

## Test Execution

### Automated Testing

The automated test script (`k8s/monitoring/test-monitoring-staging.sh`) performs a series of tests on the monitoring stack. To run the automated tests:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x k8s/monitoring/test-monitoring-staging.sh

# Run the tests
./k8s/monitoring/test-monitoring-staging.sh
```

The script will output the results of each test with a pass/fail indicator.

### Manual Testing

In addition to the automated tests, the following manual tests should be performed:

#### 1. Dashboard Visualization Testing

1. Access Grafana UI (port-forward or through ingress)
2. Verify that all dashboards load correctly
3. Check that graphs display data correctly
4. Test dashboard filters and variables
5. Verify time range selectors work as expected

#### 2. Alert Testing

1. Create a test alert condition in Prometheus
2. Verify that the alert fires when conditions are met
3. Check that alert notifications are sent correctly
4. Verify alert resolution when conditions return to normal

#### 3. User Access Testing

1. Test access with different user roles (admin, editor, viewer)
2. Verify that permissions are enforced correctly
3. Test authentication mechanisms (LDAP, OAuth, etc.)

#### 4. Backup and Restore Testing

1. Create a backup of Prometheus data
2. Create a backup of Grafana dashboards
3. Perform a restore from backups
4. Verify that all data and configurations are restored correctly

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Infrastructure Validation

**Objective**: Verify that all monitoring components are deployed and running correctly.

**Steps**:

1. Check that Prometheus pod is running
2. Check that Grafana pod is running
3. Verify that services are created and accessible
4. Check that ConfigMaps are correctly applied

**Expected Results**:

- All pods are in Running state
- All services are accessible
- ConfigMaps are correctly applied

### Scenario 2: Metrics Collection Validation

**Objective**: Verify that Prometheus is collecting metrics from all configured targets.

**Steps**:

1. Access Prometheus UI
2. Navigate to Status > Targets
3. Check that all targets are up
4. Query essential metrics to verify data collection

**Expected Results**:

- All targets show as "up"
- Essential metrics are being collected
- No scrape errors are reported

### Scenario 3: Dashboard Functionality Testing

**Objective**: Verify that Grafana dashboards are correctly displaying data.

**Steps**:

1. Access Grafana UI
2. Navigate to each dashboard
3. Verify that graphs display data correctly
4. Test dashboard variables and filters

**Expected Results**:

- All dashboards load without errors
- Graphs display data correctly
- Variables and filters work as expected

### Scenario 4: Security Testing

**Objective**: Verify that security measures are correctly implemented.

**Steps**:

1. Test network policies by attempting access from unauthorized pods
2. Verify authentication requirements for Prometheus and Grafana
3. Test RBAC permissions with different user roles

**Expected Results**:

- Unauthorized access is blocked
- Authentication is required for access
- RBAC permissions are correctly enforced

### Scenario 5: Performance Testing

**Objective**: Verify that the monitoring stack performs well under load.

**Steps**:

1. Generate load by querying Prometheus API repeatedly
2. Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
3. Check for any performance degradation

**Expected Results**:

- System remains responsive under load
- Resource usage stays within acceptable limits
- No performance degradation is observed

### Scenario 6: Rollback Testing

**Objective**: Verify that the rollback procedure works correctly.

**Steps**:

1. Simulate a failed deployment
2. Execute the rollback procedure
3. Verify that the system returns to a known good state

**Expected Results**:

- Rollback procedure executes without errors
- System returns to a known good state
- No data loss occurs during rollback

## Test Reporting

After completing all tests, a test report should be generated with the following information:

1. Test summary (pass/fail counts)
2. Detailed results for each test scenario
3. Any issues or observations
4. Recommendations for improvement

## Acceptance Criteria

The monitoring stack is considered ready for production when:

1. All automated tests pass
2. All manual test scenarios are successfully completed
3. No critical or high-severity issues are found
4. Performance metrics meet or exceed requirements
5. Security requirements are fully satisfied

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered during testing, the rollback plan should be executed:

1. Document the issues found
2. Execute the rollback script: `./k8s/monitoring/rollback-prometheus-staging.sh`
3. Verify that the system returns to the previous state
4. Address the issues before attempting redeployment
