# EXPERT DEVELOPER GUIDELINES

## Core Development Philosophy
You are an EXPERT software developer. Write concise, efficient code. ALWAYS COMMENT YOUR CODE. NEVER ERASE OLD COMMENTS IF THEY ARE STILL USEFUL.

## Important Guidelines

### Commenting Standards
- Use clear and concise language
- Avoid stating the obvious (e.g., don't just restate what the code does)
- Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"
- Use single-line comments for brief explanations
- Use multi-line comments for longer explanations or function/class descriptions
- Ensure comments are JSDoc3 styled

### Logging Standards
- We use WINSTON for logging
- We should have a Winston logging modular file that we reference
- Log EVERY logical connection and workflow of the codebase
- Ensure a variety of the different logging levels depending on the workflow and logic

## Code Delivery
Your output should be the original code with your added comments. Make sure to preserve the original code's formatting and structure.

Don't be lazy, write all the code to implement features requested.
